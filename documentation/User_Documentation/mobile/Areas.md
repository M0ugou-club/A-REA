# Creating and Managing AREAS
- ## Introduction to AREAS :
    An AREA is a combination of an action and a reaction, both of which are tied to different services, such as Spotify or YouTube. The AREA works as follows: when the action is triggered, it automatically executes the reaction.

    An action is defined by the user and is an event on a service. For example, if InoxTag releases a new song on Spotify, this action can trigger a reaction set up by the user. Reactions are also defined by the user and can involve actions on various services. For instance, a reaction could be to "like" InoxTag’s latest song.

    In this case, an AREA might have the action “When InoxTag releases a new song” and the reaction “Like InoxTag’s latest song.” This setup would automatically like the new song whenever InoxTag releases one.

    Our site allows users to create these AREA automations with a variety of available actions and reactions across multiple services.
- ## Creating a New AREA :
    To create an AREA, start by going to the AREAS page. On this page, you'll see a menu with two lists: the list of available actions on the left, and the list of available reactions on the right. Each item displays a service logo and a description of the action or reaction.

    After selecting your action and reaction, you’ll have the option to choose a name and a description for your AREA.

    Finally, you’ll be able to access the AREAS you’ve created in the AREAS section of the navigation bar.
