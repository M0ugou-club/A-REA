# Creating and Managing AREAS
- ## Introduction to AREAS :
    An AREA is a combination of an action and a reaction, both of which are tied to different services, such as Spotify or YouTube. The AREA works as follows: when the action is triggered, it automatically executes the reaction.

    An action is defined by the user and is an event on a service. For example, if InoxTag releases a new song on Spotify, this action can trigger a reaction set up by the user. Reactions are also defined by the user and can involve actions on various services. For instance, a reaction could be to "like" InoxTag’s latest song.

    In this case, an AREA might have the action “When InoxTag releases a new song” and the reaction “Like InoxTag’s latest song.” This setup would automatically like the new song whenever InoxTag releases one.

    Our site allows users to create these AREA automations with a variety of available actions and reactions across multiple services.
- ## Creating a New AREA :
    To create an AREA, start by going to the AREAS page. On this page, you’ll see a menu with two lists: the list of available actions on the left, and the list of available reactions on the right. Each item displays a service logo and a description of the action or reaction.

    In the center, you’ll find the AREA creation form. At the top, you can name your AREA, and below, add a description. This description will appear prominently in your list of AREAS.

    Next, you’ll see sections for selecting an action and a reaction. Simply click on an item from the action list on the left to select it, and then choose a reaction from the list on the right.

    Once you've set up your AREA with the desired action and reaction, just click the "Create your AREA" button at the bottom between the two lists to finalize it.
- ## Deleting an AREA :
    To delete an area, simply go to the area page and look to the right. You'll see a list of all your created areas, just move your mouse over the area you want to delete and click on the ? button that appears, once clicked press the button with the red garbage can at the bottom of the page that appears.
