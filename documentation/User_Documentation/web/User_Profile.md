- ## Change profile picture :

    To change your profile picture, go to the profile page. Below the password change section, you’ll see four boxes displaying your information, such as your first and last name. In the bottom right of these boxes, you’ll find one labeled "Photo." Below this title, there’s a button that says "Change your profile picture."
