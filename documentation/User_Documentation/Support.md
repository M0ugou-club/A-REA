# Troubleshooting and Support 
- ## FAQ :
    How is my personal information and data protected on this site?
    
    We do everything we can to protect your information. We secure your personal data by encrypting it and ensure that we do not store or retrieve any sensitive information.

    
    Why am I required to contact support to change my password if I lost it?
    
    You can change your password on the profile page if you know your current password. However, if youâ€™ve forgotten it, you need to contact support. This is because on the InoxQCB site, you can connect to other services using your account, and we prioritize security to minimize any potential vulnerabilities.
