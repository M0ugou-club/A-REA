# Connecting to Services
- ## Connecting to External Services :
    To connect to an external service, make sure you’re logged in to the InoxQCB site. Then, click on your profile picture at the top left of the page. This will open a menu where you’ll see a list of buttons below “Download App,” each labeled with a service logo and the word “Se connecter” If a button shows “Connect,” it means you’re not connected to that service. If it shows “Se déconnecter” you are already connected.

    For example, to connect to Spotify, click the button with the Spotify logo. This will open Spotify’s connection page, where you may be prompted to choose the account you want to connect. Review the permissions and information requested, and proceed with the connection process. Once complete, you’ll be redirected back to our site, and the button text should change to “Se déconnecter”

    To disconnect from a service, simply click the button labeled “Se déconnecter” for that service. The button text will then change back to “Se connecter”
